## About The Project

<img src="images/screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot"/>

We came up with the idea of this server to keep track of our Minecraft adventures.

Tired of recreating a new world every time you start a new survival or of losing your old worlds?
Then Turbocube is for you!

Our aim is to keep the game as vanilla as possible while adding a few cool features, here's a few of them:
* ü¶Ñ DiscordLink: Discord/Minecraft link, allows you to link your Discord account and receive and send messages.
* üó∫Ô∏è DynMap: Minecraft's Google maps give you a 2D and 3D map of Turbocube
* üß± ClaimChunk: Allows you to claim chunks that will be visible on the map.
